Closest Binary Search Tree Value II
The idea of this solution is pretty simple, we just iterate through the tree and append the absolute difference between the popped value and target to an array called differences, then we append the popped value to an array called eachNumber. After we have iterated through the whole array we can sort the difference array while sorting the eachNumber array. After that we return the first k numbers from eachNumber.</description></item><item><title>Leetcode 692</title><link>https://nathannaveen.dev/posts/leetcode-692/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Mar 2021 11:52:46 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://nathannaveen.dev/posts/leetcode-692/</guid><description>692. Top K Frequent Words
The Main Idea:
This solution first adds the words to an array called frequency and sorts frequency after that, return the k most frequency words.
Adding to the array Frequency:
You might be confused when we do this part:
for _, ints := range frequency { if words[ints[0]] == word { contains = true ints[1]++ break } } We can simplify the if statement into if words[frequency[i][0]] = word.</description></item><item><title>Leetcode 1752</title><link>https://nathannaveen.dev/posts/leetcode-1752/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 21:04:13 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://nathannaveen.dev/posts/leetcode-1752/</guid><description>1752. Check if Array Is Sorted and Rotated
The idea of this solution is to loop through the array, and then check whether there is a nums[i] which is greater than nums[(i+1) % len(nums)] (By the way (i+1) % len(nums) is for getting the next number) if nums[i] &amp;gt; nums[(i+1)%len(nums)] then add one to a counter called counter. Then we check whether counter is greater than or equal to 2.</description></item><item><title>Leetcode 973</title><link>https://nathannaveen.dev/posts/leetcode-973/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Mar 2021 10:43:03 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://nathannaveen.dev/posts/leetcode-973/</guid><description>973. K Closest Points to Origin
The New Distance Formula:
The Euclidean Distance Formula equals (I have drawn this in a picture because the symbols don&amp;rsquo;t aline up when writen up in text)
This can be simplifyed by taking out the square root. We can take out the square root because we are not finding the minimum distance but the point with the minimum distance, and the distance doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be square rooted.</description></item><item><title>Leetcode 347</title><link>https://nathannaveen.dev/posts/leetcode-347/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Mar 2021 15:47:24 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://nathannaveen.dev/posts/leetcode-347/</guid><description>347. Top K Frequent Elements
The idea of this solution is pretty simple. First, add all the numbers to a matrix array with the size [number of different elements][2]. Then sort the array, and then add the values to a regular array of size K.
The matrix array has a size of [number of different elemtnets][2] because we need to add every element to its corresponding place in the array and then update the frequency by adding one to it.</description></item><item><title>Leetcode 1636</title><link>https://nathannaveen.dev/posts/leetcode-1636/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Mar 2021 16:02:55 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://nathannaveen.dev/posts/leetcode-1636/</guid><description>1636. Sort Array by Increasing Frequency
The main idea of both the solutions is to add all the numbers to a matrix of lengths [len(nums)][2] and then sort each frequency of numbers by the max frequency. Suppose two values have the same frequency sort them by the value in descending order. After they are sorted, add all the values back to nums and return nums.
This is the sort:
for i := 1; i &amp;lt; len(arr); i++ { if i &amp;gt;= 1 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ((arr[i-1][0] &amp;gt; arr[i][0]) || (arr[i-1][0] == arr[i][0] &amp;amp;&amp;amp; arr[i-1][1] &amp;lt; arr[i][1])) { arr[i], arr[i-1] = arr[i-1], arr[i] i -= 2 } } The idea of it is to start at the second item (first if 0 indexed) and then check whether the frequency of the number before the current is greater than the frequency of the current number.</description></item></channel></rss>
