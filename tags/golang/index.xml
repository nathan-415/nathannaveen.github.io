Largest Perimeter Triangle
The idea of this solution is to sort the array and then keep on checking the largest three side lengths.
In the problem it asks us to &amp;ldquo;return the largest perimeter of a triangle with non-zero area.&amp;rdquo; Non-zero area means a triangle with the two smaller side lengths that add up to be greater than the greatest side length. This can be show in a couple images</description></item><item><title>Leetcode 1523</title><link>https://nathannaveen.dev/posts/leetcode-1523/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Feb 2021 17:03:24 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://nathannaveen.dev/posts/leetcode-1523/</guid><description>1523. Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range
The idea of this solution is to get the number odd numbers from 0 to high, and then subtract the number of odd numbers from 0 to low - 1. The idea can be shown by an example:
high: 7 low : 3 The odd numbers from 0 to high (7). There are 4 odd numbers from 0 to 7. The odd numbers from 0 to low - 1 (2).</description></item><item><title>Leetcode 1637</title><link>https://nathannaveen.dev/posts/leetcode-1637/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Feb 2021 16:52:08 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://nathannaveen.dev/posts/leetcode-1637/</guid><description>1637. Widest Vertical Area Between Two Points Containing No Points
points = {x, y} The idea of this solution is to ignore the y part of points because the vertical area is the made of vertical lines. Vertical lines are made up off one x value for every y value. An example could be the line x = 3, this is a vertical line at the x value 3.</description></item></channel></rss>
